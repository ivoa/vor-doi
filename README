This directory contains some artifacts dealing with a bridge between
Registry and the DOI system.

This is currently used within GAVO's voidoi service,
http://dc.g-vo.org/voidoi/q/ui.  It should be generic enough for other
projects having to deal with the translation of VOResource do datacite
metadata, though.


First, there is vor-to-doi.xslt, which is a fairly complete mapping from
VOResource to the datacite core.  There is an example record to exercise
this in vor-example.xml.  With xsltproc, the following should work to
produce a datacite record:

	xsltproc vor-to-doi.xslt vor-example.xml

In this special case, the test record already as a DOI in the VOResource
1.1 altIdentifier element.  If your VOResource record does not already
contain a DOI, you can pass one in with the doi_for_record string
parameter.  In xsltproc, this could look like this::

	xsltproc --stringparam doi_for_record 10.5072/testrec \
    vor-to-doi.xslt vor-example.xml

Second, there is a piece of python, oai2datacite.py that lets you run
the stylesheet  on a
set of records in a ivo_vor OAI-PMH response.  In particular, the script
will generate DOIs (WARNING: currently, no collision detection performed).
There is some sample input for that, too, oai-example.xml.

The command line

	python oai2datacite.py oai-example.xml

will (if you have python-lxml installed) produce a number of .datacite
files containing datacite records.
